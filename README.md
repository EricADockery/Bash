# Bash Scripting

I worked on bash scripting at AMD, but since my internship I haven't touched the program. This is my attempt to get up to speed for any interview that I may have on bash scripting. Basic Programs are going to be the start of the scripts that I am making, and hopefully I will be able to make more complex ones in no time.
